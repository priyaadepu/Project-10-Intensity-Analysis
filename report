# üìå Intensity Analysis NLP Model - Report

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Project Overview**
The **Intensity Analysis NLP Model** predicts the emotional intensity of text reviews. It classifies text into three categories: **happiness, anger, or sadness** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. The goal is to develop a model that achieves **>85% accuracy** on the test dataset.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Dataset & Preprocessing**
### **üìå Data Collection**
- Collected text samples from publicly available sentiment datasets.
- Each text sample is labeled with one of three intensity levels: **Happiness, Anger, or Sadness**.

### **üîÑ Preprocessing Steps**
- **Text Cleaning**: Removed punctuation, stopwords, and special characters.
- **Tokenization**: Split text into individual words.
- **Vectorization**: Applied **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** to convert text into numerical format.
- **Data Splitting**: Divided dataset into **80% training** and **20% testing** sets.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Model Development**
### **üìå Algorithms Used**
- **Baseline Model**: Logistic Regression
- **Advanced Models**:
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Deep Learning (LSTM)

### **üîç Feature Engineering**
- TF-IDF applied to extract meaningful features.
- Evaluated impact of **n-grams (unigrams, bigrams, trigrams)**.

### **üîß Hyperparameter Tuning**
- Used **GridSearchCV** to find the best parameters.
- Fine-tuned **SVM and Random Forest** for optimal performance.

| SVM               | 85.5%    | 84.3%     | 85.1%   | 84.7%    |
| Random Forest     | 86.1%    | 85.2%     | 86.0%   | 85.5%    |
| LSTM (Deep Learning) | 89.3% | 88.7% | 89.0% | 88.8% |

### **üöÄ Best Model Selected**: **LSTM (89.3% Accuracy)**

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Deployment Plan**
### **Option 1: Flask API Deployment**
1. Serialize trained model using `joblib`.
2. Create a Flask API (`flask_app.py`) for real-time predictions.
3. Deploy API using **Heroku/AWS/GCP**.
4. Sample API Call:
   ```json
   POST /predict { "text": "I am so happy today!" }
   ```

### **Option 2: Streamlit Web App**
1. Created `app.py` for **interactive web-based predictions**.
2. Deployed locally & on **Streamlit Cloud**.
3. Run locally:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Challenges & Solutions**
| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Handling sarcasm in text | Used BERT-based embeddings |
| Imbalanced dataset | Applied **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** |
| Model overfitting | Used **dropout layers** in LSTM |

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ **Future Work**
- Improve feature extraction using **Word2Vec & Transformer models (BERT, GPT-3)**.
- Expand dataset to cover **more diverse emotional expressions**.
- Deploy model as **mobile-friendly API** for real-world usage.

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ **Conclusion**
The **Intensity Analysis NLP Model** successfully predicts text intensity, achieving **89.3% accuracy** with LSTM. Further improvements, such as **fine-tuning transformer-based models (BERT)**, could enhance performance. The model is ready for **real-world deployment** via API and web-based applications.
