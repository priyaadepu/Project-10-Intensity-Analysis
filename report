**Title:** Intensity Analysis using NLP and Machine Learning

## **1. Introduction**
The objective of this project is to develop an intelligent system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to predict the intensity in text reviews. The model classifies text into one of three intensity levels: happiness, angriness, or sadness. This predictive capability can be utilized to optimize customer experience and provide valuable insights into sentiment analysis.

## **2. Data Collection**
Data for this project was collected from multiple sources, including manually labeled datasets containing text reviews categorized into three emotional intensities:
- **Happiness**
- **Angriness**
- **Sadness**

The datasets were loaded into a structured format using Pandas for further processing.

## **3. Data Preprocessing**
To ensure the data was clean and suitable for machine learning, the following preprocessing steps were applied:
- Removal of punctuation and special characters
- Lowercasing all text
- Tokenization using NLTK
- Stopword removal
- Lemmatization to reduce words to their base forms

TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization was used to convert text data into numerical form for machine learning models.

## **4. Feature Engineering**
Feature extraction was performed using the following techniques:
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converts text into meaningful numerical representations.
- **Label Encoding**: Converts categorical labels (happiness, angriness, sadness) into numerical values.

## **5. Model Selection and Training**
Multiple machine learning models were experimented with for classification:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

The dataset was split into training and test sets using an 80-20 ratio. The models were trained using the TF-IDF transformed data.

## **6. Model Evaluation & Results**
The trained models were evaluated using:
- **Accuracy Score**
- **Confusion Matrix**
- **Classification Report** (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of **>85%**, meeting the project requirements.

## **7. Hyperparameter Tuning**
To further improve performance, **GridSearchCV** was implemented for hyperparameter optimization. Various hyperparameters were tested, and the best combination was selected for final model deployment.

## **8. Deployment Plan**
The final model is saved using **joblib** for deployment. Steps for deployment include:
1. Save the trained model as a `.pkl` file.
2. Create a Flask API for real-time predictions.
3. Deploy the API on a cloud platform (AWS, Heroku, or Google Cloud).

## **9. Future Work**
Potential improvements include:
- Expanding the dataset to include more varied text samples.
- Implementing deep learning models (e.g., LSTMs, Transformers) for enhanced accuracy.
- Deploying as a web-based application for better accessibility.

## **10. Conclusion**
This project successfully demonstrates an end-to-end NLP pipeline for intensity analysis. The implemented model provides valuable sentiment classification and can be further improved with advanced techniques and larger datasets.
